# OperationFounder
An app for updating the scores on Operation Founder which is an annual event for Scouts and Guides in Tonbridge District in Kent.

The app syncs logs from bases spread around the countryside to the HQ who manage the event. By using this app to entering the patrol(team) number, time in and out of the base as well as the team's overall score at each base location. The HQ has a real time stream of when a patrol enters and leaves a base and the current leaderboard on the day.

Version 2.0 is on its way with a complete overhaul of how the app works.
Master Branch has version 1.
Development Branch has version 2.
