            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and

        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

        the conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        8.6. Intellectual Property and Reservation of Rights. Microsoft and its suppliers retain all right, title and interest in and to the Services, Content, the SDKs and all intellectual property rights therein, except for the limited rights expressly granted herein. This TOU does not grant Microsoft any right or license to any Company Application or Company intellectual property including intellectual property that Company has licensed from third parties.
        Except for material that we may license to you, we do not claim ownership of the content you post or otherwise provide to us, that is hosted by Microsoft or a third party hosting provider on Microsoftâs behalf, related to the Services (called a "Submission"). However, by posting or otherwise providing your Submission (and for the avoidance of doubt, where Microsoft hosts content on your behalf including by a third party hosting provider, this constitutes a Submission, but where you host or a third party hosts content on your behalf, other than Microsoft or a third party hosting provider on behalf of Microsoft, this does not constitute a Submission), you are granting to Microsoft free permission to use, copy, distribute, display, publish, transcode and otherwise modify your Submission, each in connection with the Services, and sublicense these rights to others in order to provide the Services. We may refuse to publish and may remove your Submission from the Services at any time. For every Submission you make, you must have all rights necessary for you to grant the permissions in this section. You may agree to grant Microsoft additional rights under this section by way of the process detailed in the SDKs.

        8.7. Your Responsibility. You will indemnify and hold the Microsoft parties harmless from and against any and all loss, liability, and expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) suffered or incurred by reason of any claims, proceedings or suits based on or arising out of any breach by you of any obligation or warranty under this TOU. You will be solely responsible for defending any claim, subject to Microsoft's right to participate with counsel it selects, and you will not agree to any settlement that imposes any obligation or liability on the Microsoft parties without Microsoft's prior written consent.
        8.8. We Make No Warranty. Microsoft and its suppliers provide the Services and Content "as-is," "with all faults", "as available" and without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, any and all representations, warranties or conditions of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, implied or statutory warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, accuracy or satisfactory quality), all with regard to the Services and any Content, are expressly excluded by Microsoft and its suppliers. Microsoft and its suppliers make no warranty that the Services will operate properly as integrated with the Company Applications, that the Services will be uninterrupted, or that any Content will be accurate or complete. Microsoft and its suppliers specifically disclaim any liability for end usersâ reliance on the Services. Without limiting the foregoing, Microsoft and its suppliers shall have no liability for harm to end users resulting from reliance on any map or direction provided hereunder.
        8.9. Liability Limitation. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to an amount equal to fees you have paid Microsoft for the Services for one month. Neither party nor its suppliers will be liable for any indirect damages, (including, without limitation, consequential, special or incidental damages, damages for loss of profits or revenues, business interruption, or loss of business information) arising out of or related to the Services, Content, or TOU even if advised of the possibility of such damages or if the possibility was reasonably foreseeable.
        8.10. Changes to the Services; Cancellation or Suspension of the Services; Audit. We may change, cancel or suspend your use of the Services at any time. Some changes to the Services may cause existing Company Applications to stop working. Our cancellation or suspension may be without cause and/or without notice. Upon Services cancellation, your right to use the Services stops right away. Once the Services are cancelled or suspended, any data you have stored on the Services may not be retrieved later. Microsoft reserves the right to verify your compliance with this TOU.
        8.11. General Legal Terms.

In the future we may choose to charge for all use of the Services, or change the requirements for use free of charge.
